# Code of Conduct

## 1. Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## 2. Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

    Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.

    Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.

    Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.

    Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience.

    Focusing on what is best for the community and the project.

### Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

    The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.

    Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.

    Public or private harassment.

    Publishing others' private information, such as physical or electronic addresses, without explicit permission.

    Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

    For a data science project: Any attempt to misuse the data or code for malicious purposes, or any public mockery or demeaning of the model's performance/design.

## 3. Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## 4. Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## 5. Enforcement Guidelines

The project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### Minor --> A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate.
#### Moderate --> A temporary ban from any project spaces for one week, with no public or private interaction with project participants allowed during this period.
#### Severe --> A permanent ban from any project spaces, including removal from the project's organization and prevention from future contribution

## 6. Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it to the project maintainer(s) immediately by reaching out to us on Github.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
