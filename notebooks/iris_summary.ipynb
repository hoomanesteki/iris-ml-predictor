In order to check its performance, the model was first trained on one part of the dataset and then validated on another part (test set).\n",

Each flower is represented by four attributes: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The species of the iris flower is the target variable, which can be one of three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, or Iris virginica.\n",
