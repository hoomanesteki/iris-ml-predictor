The target variable consists of three species: *Iris setosa*, *Iris versicolor*, and *Iris virginica*.

There are no missing values in the dataset, and 50 samples represent each of the three classes. The class labels were converted into numbers (0 = setosa, 1 = versicolor, 2 = virginica). A train-test split @scikit_learn, was done to maintain the separation of training and testing data. This will help evaluate the model's performance on previously unseen data.\n\n### Exploratory Data Analysis\n\nSeaborn @Waskom2021 was used to create exploratory visualizations to know the distributions and separability of features:\n\n- Pairplot to see class clustering @fig-pplot\n\n![Pairplot of Features vs Target](../results/figures/pairplot.png){#fig-pplot width=70%}\n\n- Correlation heatmap to find correlations among quantitative features @fig-corr\n\n![Heatmap of Correlation (1.0 = High +ve Correlation, 0 = No Correlation)](../results/figures/corr.png){#fig-corr width=70%}\n\n- Distribution plot indicating differences in petal length among species @fig-hist\n\n![Histogram of Classes vs Petal Width](../results/figures/histplot.png){#fig-hist width=70%}\n\nThe visualizations indicate that *setosa* is completely isolated from the remaining two species whereas *versicolor* and *virginica* have slightly overlapping areas.\n\n### Model Building\n\nA DummyClassifier (actually a classifier with no intelligence at all) was employed as a reference point for the performance comparison (nearly 33% correct predictions for the three equally balanced classes).
